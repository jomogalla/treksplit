> eventually move the contents of ./treksplit/ to ./ 
	after looking at Mozilla's (https://github.com/jbalogh/zamboni) code it seems to be what they do
	Looking at my current structure having it in a subfolder
	just doesnt really make sense

> Creating some sort of display:none area that holds all the data, that Django will populate 
	and then jQuery will be responsible for updating the data elsewhere

X Eventually translate all the tables to divs with display:table for using jQuery animations?
	would result in a lot of jQuery work but meh, animations are pretty.

> Currently the ajax calls certain urls to add/delete/modify all the shit
	huge potential security flaw!? it might be wise to transfer the data being transfered to data
	in the ajax call instead of calling a specific URL

> Add a rounding/payment option to the payment plan
	basically have, round to the nearest dollar, nearest 20 etc so that it will just round up/down
	what people owe other people, instead of having cents etc

>Dannica
	make it prettier. its super plain/clean, thinks i could do more with it

>Kyle
	i was confused at first, i don't like how it starts off with 'add' when you are starting with zero
	like it should create the first ones automagically
	same with adding a person

>Ian
	A description at the top of what it is and maybe a simple how to might be good

> Kenzie
	Header on the top.
	Maybe like a one inch header that goes across the top that just makes the site feel more defined.
	Instead of so much white space.

Facebook Announcement -

Hey all, 
I've been working on a little site in my spare time, I call it trek/split. 

Everyone enters how much they paid for event or group purchases and it tells you who owes who money. It's free and there is no registration so, check it out! 

www.treksplit.com

Thanks,
Jason

Trek/Split is an expense splitting website used when you do anything that involves group expenses that are to be shared

Trek/Split is used to easily and quickly determine who owes who money in a group setting. People enter what group items they paid and it tells you how to divide up the money afterwards.
