********************************
> eventually move the contents of ./treksplit/ to ./ 
	after looking at Mozilla's (https://github.com/jbalogh/zamboni) code it seems to be what they do
	Looking at my current structure having it in a subfolder
	just doesnt really make sense

> Creating some sort of display:none area that holds all the data, that Django will populate 
	and then jQuery will be responsible for updating the data elsewhere

> Eventually translate all the tables to divs with display:table for using jQuery animations?
	would result in a lot of jQuery work but meh, animations are pretty.

> Currently the ajax calls certain urls to add/delete/modify all the shit
	huge potential security flaw!? it might be wise to transfer the data being transfered to data
	in the ajax call instead of calling a specific URL

> INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE ID OF THE OBJECT IN THE HTML ID, USE A FUCKIN ATTRIBUTE DUMDUM

> ALSO, send 3 dicts to the template: 
	group dict, which dictates how the page displays/etc
	expense dict
	person dict,

	the template then builds the page with this info
