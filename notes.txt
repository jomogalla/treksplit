> Stack overflows about creating hashes for Django Models (for Group URL)
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16853815/how-to-generate-hash-for-django-model

> eventually move the contents of ./treksplit/ to ./ 
	after looking at Mozilla's (https://github.com/jbalogh/zamboni) code it seems to be what they do
	Looking at my current structure having it in a subfolder
	just doesnt really make sense

> Creating some sort of display:none area that holds all the data, that Django will populate 
	and then jQuery will be responsible for updating the data elsewhere

> Eventually translate all the tables to divs with display:table for using jQuery animations?
	would result in a lot of jQuery work but meh, animations are pretty.

> Currently the ajax calls certain urls to add/delete/modify all the shit
	huge potential security flaw!? it might be wise to transfer the data being transfered to data
	in the ajax call instead of calling a specific URL

> INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE ID OF THE OBJECT IN THE HTML ID, USE A FUCKIN ATTRIBUTE DUMDUM

> Interesting article on security

> Add a rounding/payment option to the payment plan
	basically have, round to the nearest dollar, nearest 20 etc so that it will just round up/down
	what people owe other people, instead of having cents etc

>Dannica
	make it prettier. its super plain/clean, thinks i could do more with it

>Kyle
	i was confused at first, i don't like how it starts off with 'add' when you are starting with zero
	like it should create the first ones automagically
	same with adding a person

>Ian
	A description at the top of what it is and maybe a simple how to might be good

> Kenzie
	Header on the top.
	Maybe like a one inch header that goes across the top that just makes the site feel more defined.
	Instead of so much white space.
